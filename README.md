# 32bit-FileRegister-ALU-Logisim
A 32-bit file register with an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) implemented using Logisim. This project demonstrates basic ALU operations and register functionality for educational purposes.

## Overview
This project implements a 32-bit file register with an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Logisim. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the functionality of a basic ALU and register file in digital logic design.

## Features
- 32-bit register file
- Basic ALU operations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- Designed and implemented in Logisim

## Getting Started
To run this project, you need to have [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) installed on your computer.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.circ` file in Logisim.
3. Explore the register file and ALU functionality by simulating the circuits.
4. Refer to word document uploaded to understand the basics of the project.
